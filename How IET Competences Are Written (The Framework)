# How IET Competences Are Written (The Framework)

This tutorial is intended to provide clear and practical guidance on how IET competences should be written for a professional registration application. It explains the recommended structure by working through a single competence and demonstrating how the **STAR** and **SMART** techniques can be applied effectively.

To ensure the guidance is accurate and aligned with assessor expectations, the structure presented here is based on a detailed review of the official **UK-SPEC framework**, which is used by the IET for both **Chartered Engineer (CEng)** and **Incorporated Engineer (IEng)** registrations.

## 1. Understanding the IET Competence Framework

The IET assesses professional competence using the **UK-SPEC (UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence)** framework. These competences are not simply a list of skills; they are defined standards that you must clearly demonstrate through evidence from your professional experience.

The framework is divided into five main competence areas, labelled **A to E**:

### A – Knowledge and Understanding
Applying appropriate technical knowledge to solve engineering problems.

### B – Design and Development
Using engineering principles to design, develop, and implement solutions.

### C – Responsibility, Management, or Leadership
Planning, organising, and controlling tasks, people, and resources.

### D – Communication and Interpersonal Skills
Communicating effectively with colleagues, stakeholders, and wider audiences.

### E – Professional Commitment
Demonstrating ethics, safety awareness, sustainability, and continuing professional development.

When preparing your application, you are required to provide clear evidence for each relevant competence. The IET strongly recommends using the **STAR** technique to structure your narrative and ensuring that your objectives and outcomes align with **SMART** principles.

## 2. Structuring a Competence Using STAR and SMART

The IET expects applicants to clearly describe their **personal contribution**, using **“I”** rather than **“we.”** This allows assessors to understand exactly what you did and the level of responsibility you held.

- **STAR** helps structure your example as a clear and logical story that an assessor can easily follow.
- **SMART** strengthens your evidence by showing that your objectives and results were specific, measurable, and meaningful.

### Selected Competence: C2

**Official Definition:**  
> *Plan, budget, organise, direct and control tasks, people and resources.*

This competence is particularly well suited to demonstrating both techniques, as effective planning relies on SMART objectives, while managing and controlling resources benefits from a clear STAR-based narrative.

## 3. Worked Example (Drafted)

### Situation – The Context

In my role as Lead Engineer for the **[Project Name]** upgrade, the project encountered a significant bottleneck during the testing phase. Each testing cycle was taking approximately **15 days**, which risked delaying final delivery to the client by nearly two weeks. This was especially critical, as the client was working to a strict regulatory deadline that could not be extended.

### Task – The SMART Objective

I took responsibility for reorganising the testing workflow. My objective was **specific and measurable**: to reduce the testing cycle from **15 days to 10 days** (a reduction of approximately **33%**) without compromising safety or compliance requirements. This improvement needed to be delivered within a **four-week timeframe** to ensure the overall project remained on schedule.

### Action – What I Did

I began by reviewing the project’s critical path and identified that three key subsystem tests were being conducted sequentially rather than in parallel. I carried out a risk assessment to evaluate whether parallel testing could be safely introduced and confirmed that it would not introduce interference or compliance issues.

Following this, I revised the testing schedule and negotiated with the Operations Manager to secure two additional technicians to support parallel testing shifts. To improve coordination and oversight, I introduced daily stand-up meetings to monitor progress against the revised schedule. I also implemented a digital logging system to replace manual records, which significantly reduced administrative overhead.

### Result – The Measurable Outcome

As a direct result of these actions, the testing cycle was completed in **9 days**, exceeding the original target of 10 days. The project was delivered **three days ahead of the regulatory deadline**, avoiding potential penalties. The revised process saved approximately **£15,000** in delay-related costs and reduced testing-phase man-hours by **12%**. The parallel testing approach was later adopted as the standard procedure for similar projects within the organisation.

## 4. Why This Approach Works for the IET

| Section   | Technique Used | Why It Is Effective |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Situation | Context | Clearly sets the scene and highlights complexity, such as regulatory constraints, without unnecessary technical detail. |
| Task | SMART | Uses concrete targets rather than vague statements, demonstrating commercial and operational awareness. |
| Action | “I” statements | Keeps the focus on your personal decisions and leadership, which is critical for assessment. |
| Result | Measurable | Quantifies impact using data and outcomes, which assessors trust more than subjective statements. |

## 5. Key Do’s and Don’ts for IET Applications

### Do
- Use **“I” statements** consistently. The IET assesses you, not your team.
- Focus on **non-routine and complex work**, showing judgement and responsibility.
- Highlight links to **other competences** where appropriate (e.g. a C2 example may also support B3 or C1).

### Avoid
- Using bullet points in competence and career history sections. The IET generally prefers well-written prose that tells a coherent story.
- Being vague about outcomes. Statements such as *“the project was successful”* should always be supported with evidence.
