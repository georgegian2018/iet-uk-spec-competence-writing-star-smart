## 🧠 Overview

This repository provides structured guidance on writing professional competence statements for IET registration (CEng, IEng, EngTech) using the **UK-SPEC framework**.

We combine two powerful methodologies to help articulate evidence effectively:
- **STAR**: *Situation, Task, Action, Result*
- **SMART**: *Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound*

All examples align with IET assessor expectations and emphasize:
- First-person narrative (“I” statements)
- Measurable outcomes and results
- Clear demonstration of personal responsibility and impact

## 1. Understanding the UK-SPEC Competence Framework

The IET uses the **UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC)** to assess registration applicants. These are not just technical checklists—they require structured, evidence-based narratives drawn from real-world experience.

The five competence areas (A–E) are:

| Code | Area | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| A | Knowledge & Understanding | Apply engineering principles and theory |
| B | Design & Development | Develop solutions using engineering methods |
| C | Responsibility, Management, Leadership | Lead tasks, teams, and manage resources |
| D | Communication | Interact clearly and effectively with stakeholders |
| E | Professional Commitment | Demonstrate ethics, safety, sustainability, and CPD |

The IET recommends combining **STAR** and **SMART** techniques to clearly present your experience.

## 2. Structuring Your Competence Using STAR & SMART

Use **“I”** statements to emphasize your personal contributions.

- **STAR** helps present a logical, story-based structure
- **SMART** strengthens your goals and outcomes with clarity and precision

### Sample Competence: C2  
**Definition**: *Plan, budget, organise, direct and control tasks, people, and resources.*

This competence is ideal for demonstrating both STAR and SMART due to its focus on measurable planning and results.

## 3. Worked Example

### 🟦 Situation  
As Lead Engineer on the **[Project Name]** upgrade, our testing cycle took **15 days**, threatening a regulatory deadline.

### 🟨 Task  
My SMART goal: reduce the cycle to **10 days** (33% faster), maintaining compliance, within **4 weeks**.

### 🟩 Action  
I:
- Reviewed the critical path  
- Proposed parallel subsystem testing  
- Recruited two technicians  
- Introduced daily stand-ups and digital logs

### 🟥 Result  
Testing completed in **9 days**, ahead of target.  
- Project delivered **3 days early**  
- Saved **£15,000**  
- Reduced test-phase labor by **12%**  
- New process adopted company-wide

## 4. Why This Approach Works

| Section | Technique | Why It’s Effective |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Situation** | Context | Sets the scene; identifies constraints |
| **Task** | SMART | Specific and measurable objectives |
| **Action** | First-person | Emphasizes personal role and decisions |
| **Result** | Quantified impact | Data-driven outcomes are persuasive |

---

## 5. Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Use **first-person “I”** language  
- Emphasize **non-routine, complex work**  
- Reference **multiple competences** when relevant  

### ❌ Avoid:
- Bullet points in narrative sections  
- Vague claims (*“the project went well”* without proof)
