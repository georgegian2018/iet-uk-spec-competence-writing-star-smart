# IET UK-SPEC Competence Writing Framework (STAR & SMART)

This repository provides practical guidance on how to write IET professional registration competences using the official UK-SPEC framework.

It demonstrates how to structure competence evidence clearly and effectively by combining:
- the **STAR** technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result), and
- **SMART** objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

The material is suitable for applicants and mentors supporting:
- Chartered Engineer (CEng)
- Incorporated Engineer (IEng)
- Engineering Technician (EngTech / ICTTech)

All examples are written in line with IET assessor expectations and focus on:
- first-person (“I”) evidence,
- measurable outcomes,
- professional responsibility and impact.
